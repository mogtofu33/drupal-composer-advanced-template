## Install

### Requirements

Require [Composer 2+](https://getcomposer.org) with [Php 7.4+](http://php.net/) and Php modules needed for composer.

### Grab code and libraries

Get and install this project

```bash
composer create-project mog33/drupal-composer-advanced-template:9.x drupal --stability dev --no-interaction
```
Set **/web** as root of your host (Apache).

Other folders (eg: vendor) should be accessible by Webserver user and not from HTTP.

### Drupal installation

#### Server / remote installation

- Create a database and a user access to this database.

- Fix files and folder permissions of **/web** folder regardless of [Securing file permissions and ownership](https://www.drupal.org/node/244924)

- Edit `.env` and select `SETTINGS_ENVIRONMENT` value, _dev_ will enable development modules and settings

- Install Drupal and choose profile **Use existing configuration**

#### Local setup with ddev

This project include a simple **Docker** stack based on great project [Ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Install [Ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)

Then launch the ddev stack:

```bash
ddev start
```

- Edit `.env` and select `SETTINGS_ENVIRONMENT` value, _dev_ will enable development modules and settings

- Install Drupal and choose profile **Use existing configuration**

- **OR**

- Use Drush command installation to run from **web** folder

```bash
ddev exec drush -y si --existing-config --account-name=admin --account-pass=password
```

_Note_: If you have a permission denied, ensure permissions on `web/sites/default` is 750.

Composer install script will create `web/sites/default/settings.php`, `settings.dev.php` and `settings.prod.php`, adapt if you need.

../vendor/bin/drush uli
